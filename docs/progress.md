# Progress Log

> Keep this as the single source of truth for development progress.
> Every entry should include: what changed, how to test, and what’s next.

## 2026-02-05

### Context / Goal
- Project: **TBX Windows UI Executor** (Win11 tray app) providing **capture/window/input primitives** over tailnet.
- Controller: mf-kvm01 (100.64.0.1)
- Executor: yc-tbx (Win11)

### Agreed constraints (already decided)
- Bind only to tailnet IP; keep IP allowlist (default `100.64.0.1`).
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Coordinate system exposed to Controller: **physical pixels**.
- Refuse input/macro when workstation is locked.
- No elevation; don’t touch UAC secure desktop.

### Current repo state
- `main` @ `8035e4e` (2026-02-05): capture endpoint + tailnet binding helper + config endpoint.

### Completed
- Implemented `GET /env` to return per-monitor bounds + DPI/scale (Windows only):
  - Added `virtualScreenRectPx`
  - Per display: `boundsRectPx`, `workAreaRectPx`, and `dpi/scale` objects
- Updated `/capture` + `/capture/selfcheck` metadata so `scale`/`dpi` match the captured monitor:
  - window/region: monitor containing capture rect center
  - screen: respects `displayIndex` (else primary)
- `mode=screen` now captures a single monitor (primary by default) instead of the entire virtual desktop.

### How to test (2026-02-05)
1) On Windows 11 with 2 monitors at different scaling (e.g., 100% and 175%):
   - Start the tray app.
   - Call `GET /env` and note `displays[i].scale.x` / `displays[i].dpi.x`.
2) Screen capture primary:
   - `POST /capture` with `{ "mode": "screen" }`
   - Verify `data.scale/data.dpi` match the primary monitor from `/env`.
3) Screen capture by index:
   - `POST /capture` with `{ "mode": "screen", "displayIndex": 1 }`
   - Verify `data.scale/data.dpi` match `/env.displays[1]`.
4) Window capture across monitors:
   - Move Notepad between monitors and run `POST /capture` with `{ "mode": "window", "window": { "processName": "notepad" } }`
   - Verify `scale/dpi` follow the monitor containing the window center.
5) Region capture across monitors:
   - Choose a region whose center lies on each monitor and call `mode=region`.
   - Verify `scale/dpi` match the monitor containing that region center.

### Notes / Risks
- DPI correctness is the foundation; do it before input.
- Multi-monitor DPI can differ.
- Per-monitor DPI uses `GetDpiForMonitor(MDT_EFFECTIVE_DPI)` (Win 8.1+). Fallback may return system DPI depending on process DPI awareness.

### Next
- Validate per-monitor DPI awareness is enabled at process startup.
- Consider returning `displayIndex/deviceName` in capture response for easier debugging.
- M2 input endpoints (`/input/mouse`, `/input/key`).
